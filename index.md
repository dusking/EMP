## Welcome to The Elevator Master Project

Do you also straggle everyday with the existential question of: Should I take the regular elevator or should I take the cargo elevator? The regular elevator is very quick - but I need to take 2 regular elevators if I'm comming from the parking space. The cargo elevator can take me from the parking space to the office floor without changing elevators - but I will have to wait more time to it. So which one will bring me faster to the office?

Don't you worry, we're here to the rescue. Each time you use some elevator - use the following buttons to add you travel time. Like this the system will have the travel time in each elevator type (regualr vs cargo) - for every day and hour, and will give you the statistic recommended behaviour.
